# Project
The towers of Hanoi

# Description
This project aims to simulate the moves of the disks in the famous "Towers of Hanoi" game by using javascript animations though DOM manipulation.

# Purpose
I made this project just for fun but also to strengthen my basic knowledge of DOM, asynchronous programming and reccurse function.

# Directives
The n given disks will be moved from the first tower as the starting point to the third tower as the destination while following the game's rules.

## How to ?
1. Enter the number of disks that you wanna see moving. (max: 9)
2. Press the start button
3. Wait until the moves' animation is finished
4. To restart, refresh the browser

# Notes
1. I've submitted the code all at once since I've not tracked the project's development with git by the time of building this project.
2. The view is not responsive and was designed inside a +1300px wide screen.
3. The javascript uses ES6 syntax out of the box so please make sure to view it on modern browsers.
4. Although it uses advanced syntax, it contains a lot of amaturish ways of writing code.
